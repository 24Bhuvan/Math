# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

A mini data analysis project using statistics and probability to explore students' exam scores across math, reading, and writing.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle – Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- **Attributes**: Gender, Race/Ethnicity, Parental Education, Test Preparation, Scores (Math, Reading, Writing)

## 📊 Key Concepts Applied
- Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode)
- Data Visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps)
- Probability (Score thresholds)
- Correlation Analysis
- Hypothesis Testing (t-test on gender-based reading performance)

## 🧪 Hypothesis Example
- **H₀**: No significant difference in reading scores between males and females  
- **H₁**: Significant difference in reading scores between males and females

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy.stats`

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python student_analysis.py
